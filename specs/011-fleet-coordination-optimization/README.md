# Fleet Coordination & Optimization — AI-Native Patterns, Playbooks & Nemosis

## Overview

Group spec for Layers 4–5 of the fleet execution layer — coordination intelligence and cost optimization. These specs implement ClawDen's binding of the abstract coordination model (spec 072) as concrete Rust traits, wire protocol, and CLI commands.

Layer 5 (Nemosis/071) is grouped here because it depends on the coordination primitives (068–069) and shares the same priority tier. All children depend on the execution foundation (090) being complete.

## Design

| Child | Layer | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `012-advanced-coordination-patterns` | 4 | Pluggable org-chart patterns: hierarchy, pipeline, committee, marketplace |
| `013-ai-native-coordination-primitives` | 4 | Speculative swarm, context mesh, fractal decomposition, generative-adversarial, stigmergic |
| `014-ai-native-domain-playbooks` | 4 | Applied compositions for software engineering, finance, marketing, research, legal, devops |
| `015-sdd-ai-native-playbook` | 4 | Spec-driven development playbook — exploration, hardening, living graph maintenance |
| `016-nemosis-teacher-student-distillation` | 5 | Teacher-student knowledge distillation for fleet cost optimization |

Implementation is layered: 067 → 068 → 069/070 → 071.

## Plan

- [ ] Complete 067 (org-chart patterns) as coordination foundation
- [ ] Complete 068 (AI-native primitives) extending the coordination surface
- [ ] Complete 069–070 (domain + SDD playbooks) applying primitives
- [ ] Complete 071 (Nemosis) for cost optimization via distillation

## Test

- [ ] Advanced coordination patterns produce correct results via the message bus
- [ ] AI-native primitives produce outputs no single agent could achieve alone
- [ ] Nemosis distillation reduces fleet cost by routing to student models without quality degradation
